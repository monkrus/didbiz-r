**Optional AR & interactive content** ‚Äì Display 3D logos or product demos through augmented-reality overlays.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React Native (0.73+) with Expo SDK 51+, TypeScript and expo-router for routing.

**Camera & scanning:** expo-camera (CameraView) for QR/barcode scanning (the old expo-barcode-scanner is deprecated); react-native-nfc-manager for NFC read/write.

**UI:** shadcn/ui with optional NativeWind for Tailwind-style utilities.

**Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions). Optional backend API built with Express or NestJS for custom endpoints.

**DevOps:** GitHub Actions + Expo EAS for CI/CD; Jest and Detox/Maestro for testing; Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics and Sentry for monitoring.

## üßæ Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node 16+, Yarn or npm, and the Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`). Create a Firebase project and gather your API keys.

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/digital-card-app.git
cd digital-card-app
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

### Configure Firebase:

Create a `firebaseConfig.ts` file with your Firebase configuration and initialize Firebase (see Expo's Firebase guide for details). Add environment variables (API keys, Auth domain, etc.) to a `.env` file and load them using `expo-constants` or `react-native-dotenv`.

### Run locally:

```bash
expo start
```

Use the Expo Go app or a simulator/emulator to preview the app.

### Build for production:

Use Expo EAS:

```bash
eas build --platform ios
eas build --platform android
```

Follow Expo's prompts to configure app-store credentials.

## üì¶ Usage

**Create your card:** Sign up with email or SSO (Google/Apple). Fill out personal and company details, upload images and choose a template. The app generates a QR code and NFC data for sharing.

**Share:** Open the "Share" screen to display your QR code, tap an NFC tag or send a link via SMS/email. Add the card to Apple/Google Wallet for offline sharing.

**Scan & import:** Use the camera to scan another user's QR code; review and save the contact. For paper cards, optionally enable OCR scanning (requires additional setup).

**Manage contacts:** View, tag and search your contacts. Add notes or follow-up reminders. Export contacts to your CRM or as VCF/CSV.

**Dashboard & analytics:** For team plans, admins can view analytics on card views and shares, manage user roles and configure company-wide templates.

## üîê Security & Compliance

Our app adopts industry-standard security measures:

- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.2+ in transit.
- **Authentication & Access:** Supports SSO (Google, Microsoft, Okta) and multi-factor authentication; implements role-based access controls.
- **Centralized management:** Admins can revoke access and monitor usage, preventing unauthorized sharing or duplication.
- **Card-level protection:** Cards can be password-protected and set to expire.
- **Phishing detection:** Built-in scanning detects malicious links and anomalous activity.
- **Compliance:** Designed for GDPR, CCPA and HIPAA compliance, with SOC 2 Type II aligned practices.
